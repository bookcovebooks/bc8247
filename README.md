## About This Book

On a snowbound train at the edge of the Arctic, David Raine tells a
stranger his story: a tale of a man destroyed by his wife's betrayal, a
man who walked away from vengeance into the darkness of his own despair.
The stranger is Father Roland, a wilderness missioner who has spent
years in the vast northern forests. He knows something about men who
have lost themselves—and he knows how they can be found again.

"Will you come with me?" the Little Missioner asks, offering David
escape into a world of mystery and savage glory, where the wind wails
through spruce forests and the cold cuts like a knife. But the North
holds its own secrets: a woman searching desperately for a man named
Michael O'Doone, and truths buried deeper than snow.

A story of redemption and wilderness, where broken souls seek healing in
the last untamed places of the earth.
